# zyapi / ViralFlow AI

ViralFlow AI is a local-first MVP for turning videos you own or are authorized to process into reviewable short-form clip candidates.

## Current scope: local MVP through the automated processing workflow

- Phase 1: Next.js dashboard, FastAPI API, SQLite persistence, migrations, real metrics, activity feed.
- Phase 2: source-channel records and a safe YouTube OAuth connection boundary. No credentials are included.
- Phase 3: authorized local video upload/library with duplicate detection and FFprobe validation when available.
- Phase 4: local transcription and Ollama adapters with truthful connection health checks.
- Phase 5: transcript-based moment detection with deterministic fallback heuristics and persisted candidates.
- Phase 6: FFmpeg vertical 9:16 extraction from candidate moments.
- Phase 7: SRT/ASS subtitle generation from timestamped transcript segments and editable metadata.
- Phase 8: manual approve/reject workflow with metadata edits.
- Phase 9: rule-based IST-aware scheduling with daily caps and minimum intervals.
- Phase 10: guarded resumable YouTube upload adapter with private/unlisted/public visibility.
- Phase 11: analytics snapshot API and top-clip summaries that distinguish no data from unavailable data.
- Phase 12: automation control-center service states with start/pause/resume/stop/retry commands.
- Phase 13: optional bearer protection for mutations, restrictive CORS, storage boundaries, migration-safe schema, and failure records.
- Phase 14: repeatable unit tests and container smoke-test scaffolding.
- Phase 15: Docker deployment scaffolding and a documented safe path to PostgreSQL/object storage/cloud hosting.

The local worker can automatically run upload → transcription → Qwen analysis → vertical clip extraction → SRT/burned subtitles → validation. Approved clips can be published through the official YouTube API when OAuth credentials are configured.

The implementation deliberately does not download videos from monitored YouTube channels. Monitoring metadata and acquiring authorized media are separate workflows.

## Run locally

### Backend

```powershell
cd backend
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The API is expected at `http://localhost:8000`.

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`. External integrations remain disabled until configured and tested. Set `ENABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKER=true` to process uploaded videos automatically.

## Safety boundaries

- Only upload or process files you own, licensed, or explicitly authorized to use.
- Never put Google client secrets, OAuth refresh tokens, Ollama credentials, or Supabase service keys in browser code.
- A green integration status is only shown after a real health check succeeds.
- The default worker concurrency is one heavy job at a time for a 16 GB laptop.

See [EXTERNAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md](EXTERNAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md) before connecting YouTube, Ollama, Faster-Whisper, or Supabase.
